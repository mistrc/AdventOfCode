# AdventOfCode
Finally started doing the advent of code (2022), well doing it properly as last years attempt at it using excel will not count, and so I thought I should share my code.  No idea if I will attempt this again next year, but it has been fun so far

## 2022
Did each day in sequence without regard for which was the current day.
Got stuck on part 2 for day 11, looked it up, and am annoyed I didn't think of it.
Got stuck on part 1 for day 16, I can't see what is wrong with my code, really need someone else to look at it.
Also did 25th day as my eldest said we should try one together.
